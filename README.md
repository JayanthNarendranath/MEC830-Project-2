This is a fourth year Mechatronics Systems Design Engineering Project. This project involves the following tasks:
1) To manually move a robotic car using a remote.
2) To make the robotic car move along a desired path.
3) To make the robotic car avoid colliding with obstacles.
4) To make the robotic car move along the desired path of a box.

Designing, building, coding, and problem-solving are the skills used to successfully complete the project. The programming language used is C++ in Arduino IDE.
